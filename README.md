# EventLandingPageTemplate

This is a (relatively) simple event landing page for your event. It's based on Bootstrap and uses AngularJS for databinding. 
Different translations are support via the angular-translate module.

To start using the template open js/EventInformation.js. The eventInfo JS object you see there is used for databinding event data.
Now Simply replace the data in eventInfo with your own data. 

You will also need to setup the singup for at the bottom (done in js/main.js).

Finally you can head over to /style. Do some tweaking and better integrate this template with the style of the app around it,
